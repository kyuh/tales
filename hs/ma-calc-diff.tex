% Central question: What is the slope of this line?
% (Insert figure of tangent at x^2 for some positive val)
%	(Include the graph lines in this one?, but point to/highlight the tangent somehow)
% ACTUALLY, maybe we shouldn't have this figure at the start - see approach below.






% TODO: Should this chapter have a broader intro?


\section{A Line's Rise and Fall}

% Lines have slope
%	- We often find it by saying - if there are two points on the line, then we can see how much 
% Next section: How can we find the slope of *this* (tangent) line?

Consider a line on a graph:

% TODO: Insert figure of single line on graph
\vspace{2in}

One of its major features is its \textbf{slope} -- how fast does it rise or fall? Some lines, like the dark lines below, are nearly flat -- but some lines are very "steep". In the figure below, the red lines "rise" very quickly, while the blue lines rapidly "fall".

% TODO: Insert a figure with many generated lines (not necessarily all with same y-intercept). Establish a gradient red -> black -> blue by slope, as described above.
\vspace{2in}

How we can state this more precisely? A line is a function -- let's call it $l$, so $l(x)$ is the value of the function at some $x$.

If a line is "rising" rapidly, then $l(x)$ increases a lot when we increase its $x$-value. If it's falling rapidly, then $l(x)$ \textit{decreases} quite a bit when we increase $x$. And for a line that's relatively flat, $l(x)$ will change slowly, even as we change the $x$-value quite a bit.

% TODO: Illustrate rising line with a big jump in y relative to a jump in x
\vspace{2in}

Let's say we know of any two points on the line, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, where $y_1 = l(x_1)$ and $y_2 = l(x_2)$. Then the quantity:

\begin{equation}
\label{def-slope}
m = \frac{l(x_2) - l(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}
\end{equation}

basically says "how rapidly $l(x)$ changes relative to $x$". 

We'll define $m$ in Equation \ref{def-slope} as the \textbf{slope}. If $m$ is large and positive, then $l$ is rapidly "rising" -- if $m$ is large and negative, it's rapidly "falling", and a small $m$ (close to 0) would mean an almost flat line.

\begin{exercise}
\label{slope-qns}
Having a consistent slope for a line $l$ only works if $l$ is actually a line. If we tried to use Equation \ref{def-slope} on an arbitrary function $f$, we'd get all sorts of different slopes, depending on what we chose for $x_1$ and $x_2$!

%TODO: Figure with multiple secant lines for f(x) = x^2, let's say going through 1
\vspace{2in}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Let's demonstrate this point. Let's take $f(x) = x^2$. Try using $x_1 = 0$ but switching between $x_2 = 1, 2, 3$. What "slopes" do you get?

\item Let's give a brief "proposal" for how a straight line should be defined: We'll say that for \textit{any} two values $x_1$ and $x_2$, we should always get the same slope using Equation \ref{def-slope}. 

Given this proposition, prove that we can always write the function $l$ in the form $l(x) = mx + b$. (Also, can we write $b$ in terms of $l$? Any significance of this value in particular?)
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Exercise \ref{slope-qns}}

\subsubsection{Part b}

We know that the "slope" is the same for any points $x_1$ and $x_2$. 

Let's pick a particular value for $x_1$ --- say, $x_1 = 0$. Then, no matter what $x_2$ is, we know that:

\begin{equation*}
m = \frac{l(x_2) - l(0)}{x_2 - 0} = \frac{l(x_2) - l(0)}{x_2}
\end{equation*}

and therefore, 

\begin{equation*}
m x_2 = l(x_2) - l(0)
\end{equation*}

and therefore, 

\begin{equation*}
l(x_2) = m x_2 + l(0)
\end{equation*}

We now have the functional form we were looking for, where $b = l(0)$. In other words, $b$ is the value of our function at 0. (This value is often called the "$y$-intercept", because it's the value of the function when it crosses the "$y$-axis" of a graph, i.e. when the function's input is 0.)

&= nx^{n-1} + 0 && \text{($k-1$ is positive at all terms, so all $h^{k-1}$ terms approach 0)}\\
