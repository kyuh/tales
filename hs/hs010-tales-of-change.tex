% Notes to authors:

% - Don't be afraid to just start writing, you'll probably

% - We can't introduce all of science in this book, and it's

% Thoughts on style:
% - Use shorter paragraphs, when possible. They're easier to read.

\section{Numbers in Our World}

\subsection{}

The position of an object, the amount of fluid in a bucket, the concentration of something in something else (say, of oxygen in the air), the force generated by a rocket's engines -- these are all things describable with some combination of numbers and "units" (which tell us "numbers of what"). 

% TODO: Clarify what a reference point is.

Some fitting examples of such quantities, respectively, could be "5.266 feet to the right of that telephone pole"\footnote{This quantity also has a "reference point". The quantity "5.266 feet" alone wouldn't very useful in describing where our object is.}, "15.2 grams per liter (or 15.2 g/L)", and 7,500,000 pounds.\footnote{Saturn V first stage thrust, \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V}}

% TODO: Possibly clarify that the telephone pole is a reference point. 
% TODO: That footnote looks an awful lot like a square.  


Moreover, unlike some other measurements -- such as the number of balls in an urn, or the number of times the word "the" appears in this book -- we can describe our previous quantities with a much greater set of numbers than the "counting numbers" $(1, 2, 3, ...)$. We can't really have 1.6 balls in an urn (even if a ball were cut up, it's not really a "ball" anymore), but it makes sense to have 1.6 liters of fluid in a bucket. We could also have 1.7 liters in that bucket, or pretty much any quantity in between 1.6 and 1.7 liters (1.6333, $\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$\footnote{This quantity is called the "golden ratio", and it appears in a lot of interesting places. Look it up!}, etc.) - any such value would make sense here. \footnote{Some of you may be thinking about the fact that fluid is just a bunch of atoms and molecules, and that those aren't really indivisible. But our "infinitely divisible fluid" is a nice approximation for now.}

% TODO: Again, footnotes are numbers. This is annoying and confusing. 

\textbf{Exercise 1:} 



\section{Changing the Numbers}

%Say I started a stopwatch, and then immediately left from Los Angeles toward San Francisco (about 350 miles away), arriving at time $t = 5$ hours. I moved across

% Many such quantities have the ability to change over time, and this change is usually described through another quantity. 

% For example, for something to move from point A to point B, it must have, at some point, had some nonzero speed. Let's say

% TODO: Really use the term "nonzero"?
% TODO: Insert the fluid example





Say I were at the beginning of a long, straight road. I start my stopwatch, and proceed to drive along that road at a certain \emph{speed} (say, 70 miles per hour). 

I now have enough information to say where I am on the road at \emph{any} given time. For example, 

\begin{itemize}
\item At $t = 1$ hour, I am 70 miles down the road.
\item At $t = 3$ hours, I am 210 miles down the road.
\item At $t = 0.6525$ hours, I am 45.675 miles down the road.
\end{itemize}

The speed is essentially "rate of change information" for position. The name of the unit itself is suggestive: We are traveling at 70 miles \emph{per hour}.
